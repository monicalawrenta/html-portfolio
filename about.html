<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Monica Lawrenta. I am a lawyer with six years of experience, specializing in corporate and commercial law. I was unemployed since March 2025 due to company closure and thinking about changing my career path. You must be wondering why, well, I want to be able to enter the tech world as it is rising pretty massively.</p>

<p>I am starting my journey as web developer and learning a lot about html, css and javascript. I hope to be able to create my own website soon and strenghten my skills to be software engineer. </p>
